Hey there! I am Chenle, a freshly gradurated PhD (Oct 2024) in High Performance Computing, from UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya) and BSC (Barcelona Supercomputing Center). I came to BSC in 2019, since then, I have been advised by Dr.[Sara Royuela](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7644-0868) and Dr. [Eduardo Quiñones](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5465-964X).

My research interests lie in High Performance Computing. More specifically, I am interested in parallelizing applications with [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). Basically, I try to make scientific, or not, applications running faster with OpenMP directives, by modifying its underlying compiler and runtime (mainly LLVM), or by offloading them onto GPUs.
