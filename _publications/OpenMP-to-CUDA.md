title: "OpenMP to CUDA graphs: a compiler-based transformation to enhance the programmability of NVIDIA devices"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/OpenMP-to-CUDA
excerpt: 'This paper presents a novel compiler transformation technique that automatically transforms OpenMP code into CUDA graphs, combining the benefits of programmability of a high-level programming model such as OpenMP, with the performance benefits of a low-level programming model such as CUDA.'
